Two practice sessions were held in the morning and in the afternoon before the evening race.[2] With a time of 29.981 seconds, Wimmer was the quickest in the opening session ahead of Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht, Reutimann, and Shane Huffman.[12] Positions six through ten were occupied by Hamilton, Erik Darnell, Travis Kvapil, Todd Bodine, and Kelly Bires.[12] In the second practice session, Wimmer was once again quickest with a lap time of 29.821 seconds, followed by Almirola, Johnny Benson Jr., Brad Coleman, Jason Keller, Leffler, Darnell, Huffman, Scott Lagasse Jr., and Leicht.[13]

Forty-four cars entered qualifying;[14] due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Almirola qualified his No. 20 car on pole position with a time of 29.608 seconds.[15] Almirola was set to step aside for the race, however, as Nextel Cup Series regular Denny Hamlin was scheduled to travel from Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California to compete in the Saturday night event in Milwaukee. Almirola, who also qualified Hamlin's car on the pole the year before, commented, "Man, two poles in a row at Milwaukee and I don't get to race. Something's got to be set for that. I'll sit on the pit box and watch. I've got a lot to learn about racing these Busch cars and Denny is really, really good, so I'll just sit there and listen and learn all I can from Denny."[16]

Almirola was joined on the front row by Leffler, while Wimmer, Coleman, and Huffman rounded out the top-five qualifiers.[15] Bodine, Benson, Reutimann, Edwards, and Lagasse made up positions six through ten.[15] Danny Efland was the only driver who failed to qualify as he did not set a qualifying time.[17] Edwards replaced Kvapil in the No. 60 car after practice, qualifying in ninth. Like Hamlin, Edwards was also traveling from Sonoma and nearly missed qualifying, later remarking, "One minute later, we wouldn't have made it."[18]

Race
NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin waves to fans before a race.
Denny Hamlin stepped into Almirola's car on lap 59 and proceeded to win the race.
The 250-lap race began at 8:00 p.m. EDT, and was televised live in the United States on ESPN2.[2] Hamlin's helicopter could not find a place to land in the infield; the helicopter pad was blocked by parked cars,[19] forcing Hamlin to land elsewhere and arrive late via ground transportation.[20] Hamlin was thus unable to start the race in Almirola's car,[18] forcing Almirola to start the race himself.[18] Ragan, the third Nextel Cup regular traveling to the track from Sonoma along with Hamlin and Edwards, replaced Darnell in Roush's No. 6 car; Ragan was forced to move to the rear of the field because of the driver swap and an engine change, as was Chase Miller who went to a backup car.[21]

Almirola maintained his lead from pole position for the first 43 laps before being passed by Edwards.[18] The caution had been displayed on lap 30 due to oil on the track in turn four,[21] and shortly after the lap 43 restart, Edwards took over the lead of the race.[21] On lap 57, Ron Hornaday Jr. was involved in an accident, prompting another caution period.[18] It was under this caution period that the Gibbs team elected to make the driver change, and Hamlin took over driving the car for the remainder of the race.[18]

Hamlin lost a lap and fell to 34th place,[22] remaining a lap down until lap 149 when he received the free pass, allowing him to return to the lead lap. Edwards, meanwhile, continued to lead the race for a total of 123 laps, before Mike Wallace assumed the race lead.[21] Six laps later, on lap 173, Hamlin completed his comeback drive to retake the lead for the No. 20 team.[21] Edwards, meanwhile, suffered misfortune in the form of a flat right rear tire around the same period in the race,[23] forcing him to pit with 77 laps remaining.[22]

On lap 223, Kreyer was involved in an accident, causing the caution to be displayed again.[21] Wimmer assumed the lead after pit stops, holding it until the caution came out again for Kevin Hamlin's accident.[21] On the restart, Wimmer battled for the lead with Leffler, while Hamlin made it three-wide to retake the lead with thirteen laps to go.[18] Marc Mitchell, Richard Johns, and Brent Sherman crashed on lap 244, requiring another caution to be displayed.[21] The race restarted with four laps remaining, with Hamlin retaining the lead to the finish.[18] Since NASCAR rules credit the finishing position to the starting driver, Almirola was awarded the win.[24] Wimmer, Leffler, and Coleman followed in second through fourth,[18] while Keller, Bodine, Reutimann, Edwards, Benson, and Huffman completed the top-ten.[21] Hamlin's margin of victory over Wimmer was .502 seconds.[21]

Post-race comments
"I didn't want to do it. I knew he would be really upset."

Hamlin after the race, explaining his hesitancy to get in the car[25]
Hamlin appeared in Victory Lane to represent Almirola's first career win in front of a crowd of 41,900 attendants, earning $66,823 for the victory; both the win and the prize money were credited to Almirola,[21] while team president J. D. Gibbs confirmed that Almirola would receive the winner's check.[26] Hamlin credited Almirola for putting the team in a good position prior to the race, saying Almirola "did all the hard work".[25] Runner-up Wimmer was taken aback that Gibbs elected to make the driver change: "I was surprised they did it, because Aric was running a good race."[25] He also believed fewer caution periods may have given him a better chance to win the race, saying, "I just drove as hard as I could, and unfortunately we weren't as good on the short runs. We'd get going after twenty laps, and I didn't need those cautions. Maybe we'll get a win one day. Maybe we won't. I don't know."[20] Gibbs explained that Almirola was frustrated after being taken out of the car: "He's upset. I left a message for him [Saturday] night. I know he's upset. I would be too if I'm in his shoes."[26] He also expressed relief that Hamlin was able to win the race, arguing, "Thank goodness he won. It would have looked bad if he didn't."[3]

When explaining why the team made the decision to put Hamlin in the car, Gibbs said, "I told those guys as a group, if you think Denny can get in the car and win the race, let's go. Let's do that. If you don't think he can do that, let Aric run it out. Our guys kind of thought about it as a group and said, 'OK, we think Denny can run well and we're fast enough to win the race.' That was a huge discouragement of course to Aric."[26] Other reasons included sponsorship obligations with Rockwell Automation, which sponsored the No. 20 car. Coleman, a Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, believed, "That might have had something to do with it."[25] Almirola also expressed his belief that Rockwell, who are headquartered in Wisconsin,[26] wanted Hamlin to drive during the race. "I totally understand the Gibbs side of the situation. You need that Cup superstar to sell sponsorship. It's not easy to sell sponsorship for somebody who hasn't proven themselves yet, and I understand that. At the time, in the heat of the moment, I was deep in the battle of the race. I didn't totally agree and understand the situation. But looking back on it now, I understand it. Rockwell's invested a lot in Denny Hamlin and Joe Gibbs Racing, so they deserved everything they got there at Milwaukee. They deserved to have their racecar in the spotlight and I was happy that I got the pole for them and that Denny won the race."[27] He also said he did not consider himself to have won his first career race. "I feel like I was a part of it, but by no way, shape or form do I feel like that was my first victory. I feel like my first victory is still to come and I'll actually be in the car when it crosses the start-finish line for that one."[27]

Edwards, with close cropped hair, waves while wearing his red, sponsor-filled racing suit.
Carl Edwards remained the Drivers' Championship leader after the race with 2,686 points.
The driver change also attracted criticism from ESPN journalist Terry Blount, who called it "a Busch-league move", writing: "As if we don't have enough Cup dominance in the Busch Series, now they're replacing Busch drivers after a race starts."[3] He continued, "Almirola was furious. Good for him. He should be furious. If a driver isn't angry about getting pulled from the car in the middle of a race, then he needs to take up another profession."[3]

Edwards, who led the most laps and recovered to finish eighth after dominating the early stages of the race, insisted the night was "still fun", saying: "It was pretty frustrating. But you know what's cool? We raced hard and we had a lot of fun racing here at Milwaukee. Congratulations to Denny Hamlin. I can't believe they did a driver switch and he still won the race; that's pretty awesome ... we just kind of had a bad luck night."[22]

The result kept Edwards in the lead in the Drivers' Championship with a new total of 2,686 points. Reutimann and Ragan improved their positions to second and third (albeit 776 and 846 points behind) respectively, while Blaney and Kevin Harvick fell to fourth and fifth. Leffler, Ambrose, Hamilton, Smith, and Leicht rounded out the top ten.[28] Roush's No. 60 team also maintained the lead in a much closer Owners' Championship with 2,686 points; Wimmer's strong second-place finish left Childress's No. 29 team only 188 points behind Roush, while Gibbs's No. 20, Childress's No. 21, and DeLana Harvick's No. 33 remained third, fourth, and fifth.[29] Chevrolet maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 124 points; Ford, Dodge, and Toyota followed with 113, 72, and 65 respective points.[30]

Blogspot source?
Hi all, I'm relatively new to editing Wikipedia and I'm trying to add sources to an article I wrote that's been declined for havinf too few sources. I'm trying to add a blogspot source (independent album review and interview with the artist), but Wikipedia gave me a warning so I wanted to ask about the rules. Described the problem in further detail here: Draft talk:Macroblank

Thanks in advance for the help! LucasThree (talk) 16:27, 18 June 2022 (UTC)

Hi @LucasThree, welcome to the Teahouse. Blogs are generally considered unreliable, and since there's also an interview with the artist, the independence is questionable too. If the author of the blog is an established critic, the source might be usable in some ways, but probably not to establish notability. 174.21.23.32 (talk) 16:37, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
LucasThree, welcome to Wikipedia! I hope you liked the place and decided to stay. For an article to be published here, it should be notable and should have reliable sources as citations/references for the sake of verifiability. Wikipedia doesn't accepted original research. Please go through introduction and referencing for beginners to learn more about how the site works. Baggaet (talk) 16:43, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
@LucasThree Just so you know, blogs aren't considered "reliable" because there is rarely any editorial control, no fact-checking, and there's generally no way for anyone else to ask for corrections or to highlight incorrect information. Anyone can say anything they want in a blog. If WP didn't restrict the use of blogs as sources, that incorrect info could be used to "source" a WP article. I hope that helps explain the policy. An interview and review probably wouldn't be "made up", but the WP policy is there so we don't need to figure that out. 73.127.147.187 (talk) 02:07, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
Alert about my talk page at a Wiki I have not visited
Hi, I don't think I have ever visited the Hindi Wiki, and I certainly don't speak it. Why would I have an alert that someone posted to my (presumably) non-existent talk page there? Is this a sign of account hacking or spoofing or something? I didn't open it, or the Hindi wiki, so I don't have a diff. Thanks NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 19:06, 18 June 2022 (UTC)

You must have visited it today, they have an auto-generated welcome for all "new accounts" which means your account automatically attaches to any Wikipedia project you visit. PRAXIDICAE?? 19:10, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
Are you kidding? I've been deep into deleting fluff from my en.wiki watchlist, and working on pages directly related to the Jan 6 committee hearings. If I click an image (template FILE) on an article in the en.wiki, might it open in the Hindi wiki without my realizing it? That's the only thing I can remotely think that I did myself. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 19:19, 18 June 2022 (UTC) PS thanks for the help figuring it out. I guess I must not have sounded appreciative when I snorted..... I just don't think that's it. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 19:21, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
You can probably check your history, it's really not a big deal. If you clicked some sort of interwiki link, and it was through Hiwiki, it would automatically connect because of WP:CENTRALAUTH. PRAXIDICAE?? 19:27, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
I know about version histories and contribs lists.... is there a log of what things I merely visited? That would be cool, how do I find it?NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 19:30, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
No, I meant your internet browser's history. PRAXIDICAE?? 19:35, 18 June 2022 (UTC)les
I have all the bells and whistles set up to delete my footprints, at least periodically, and even restore my partition from an image file roughly monthly, so that's not an option.NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 20:02, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
CentralAuth should have a record of when you visited a given wiki and thus got autobestowed an account (due to SUL). ?J?sk? Couriano v^_^v a little blue Bori 19:44, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
That's interesting. It says I've been "Attached" to a long list of wikis (what the devil is test2.wiki?) .... but at login. And all those other wikis in the list are the same, attached at login. What's that about? I almost always do wiki on a desktop from home in the US. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 20:02, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
@NewsAndEventsGuy: That's your WP:SUL. It reserves your username on all wikis (so nobody else can impersonate you), and automatically creates your local account when you visit a wiki you've never visited before. ??FormalDude talk 20:08, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
"SUL"!!! How wonderfully ironic given the immediately following thread we both tried to answer about being NPOV writing on religion.... I still say I have NEVER visited these other places, so don't understand why I got a notice about my (fake?) talk page at the Hindi wiki today. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 20:16, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
Your hindi talk page is real: hi:????? ??????:NewsAndEventsGuy. I don't know why it would have been created without you visiting it though. ??FormalDude talk 20:24, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
It's because whether they realize it or not, they must have clicked something and visited hiwiki. This thread is a bit of a nothingburger though, there's nothing enwiki can do and it's a normal part of Wikimedia/mediawiki's functions. PRAXIDICAE?? 20:27, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
@NewsAndEventsGuy A lot of browsers will preload pages to speed up your browsing experience, e.g. chrome has a setting to "preload pages for a faster browsing experience" in the cookie settings page. If this is enabled then when you visit a page with links to other projects in it your browser might start loading pages from other projects in the background, at which point the servers will create a local account for you and you'll recieve a welcome. 192.76.8.88 (talk) 20:33, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
Test2.wiki is a test wiki for playing around with software features and testing the stability of new versions of mediawiki. 192.76.8.88 (talk) 20:36, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
@192.76.8.88: Thanks, preloading makes sense. I don't see anything in my settings (current Firefox). I use google for a home page, and there are icons for commonly used things, one of which is wikipedia. I click on that and get the global main wiki page. Do the other language wikis randomly populate, or change once in awhile? And could I be triggering some preload code just when my mouse rolls over one? That would explain it. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 20:49, 18 June 2022 (UTC)

@NewsAndEventsGuy Firefox will preload content from sites without you clicking on them in some situations, see this support document for the details. The language links on the homepage are based on the pageviews of each project and do get changed occasionally. It's probably going to be impossible to figure out exactly what caused you to visit the Hindi project. 192.76.8.88 (talk) 20:55, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
OK much obliged NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 20:58, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
THANKS ALL, my main concern was to verify this isn't a sign of hacking or ID theft or some other nasty so I'll relax and go feed the chickens.NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 20:58, 18 June 2022 (UTC)

@NewsAndEventsGuy: You are correct that you didn't visit the Hindi Wikipedia but it's not about preloading. You edited Template:Supplement years ago here at the English Wikipedia. Yesterday a user imported the template with page history to the Hindi Wikipedia.[1] You are in the imported page history so your account was automatically created at the Hindi Wikipedia: hi:Special:Logs/NewsAndEventsGuy. Some wikis post welcome messages to users when their account is created. You were alerted of such a post. This has confused many users. I proposed to disallow such welcome messages at meta:Welcoming policy but the proposal hasn't received much attention. PrimeHunter (talk) 01:31, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
That's flippin' insane. I did what I could and added a SUPPORT notvote there. I want these two hours back. Thanks for caring and explaining. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 02:04, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
This may be a red herring(?), but try going to your Preferences > Notifications > and make sure "Show notifications from other Wikis" is not checked. Shantavira|feed me 08:35, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
That's probably too drastic for most users. I find cross-wiki notifications useful most of the time. If you really don't want them then you can disable them at Special:GlobalPreferences#mw-prefsection-echo. If you only disable them at Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-echo here at the English Wikipedia then you will still see them as soon as you visit any other Wikimedia wiki, e.g. Commons or Wikidata. PrimeHunter (talk) 09:28, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
Thanks for the preferences tip. Maybe a cross wiki notification could come with a smallcase link to HELP:Crosswiki Notices that would walk people through what I've learned here? Thanks for the help all NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 10:00, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
@PrimeHunter Your proposed policy change says "if the user once edited a page..." I wonder if it would be clearer if the proposal said "edited a page (including a template)...". Still, you are right about it not getting much attention, sadly. 73.127.147.187 (talk) 02:14, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
How to edit a timeline?
The article Cradle of civilization includes near the bottom a section titled Timeline and a graph dating the founding civilizations of the world. I want to edit the graph but clicking the edit button, the timeline seems to have been put into the article by inserting only a template (if that is what it is called) of double curly brackets enclosing the words "World timeline." What is this? How does one go about editing the timeline? Smallchief (talk) 23:18, 18 June 2022 (UTC)

hi @Smallchief and welcome to the teahouse! you can find the page at {{Worldhistory}}. this template generates the timeline so it can be imported to other pages without repeating the code, and updates all other pages when it is updated. happy editing! ??  melecie  talk - 23:45, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
Thanks. Smallchief (talk) 00:27, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
@Smallchief: Melecie linked the wrong template. As you said, the code says {{World timeline}}. That means Template:World timeline is used. See more at Help:A quick guide to templates. This template uses the feature at Help:EasyTimeline syntax. PrimeHunter (talk) 01:11, 19 June 2022 (UTC)

Twin
Hello,I would love to know if adding that a notable person has a twin sister is trivia? Example Noah Schnapp. I added that he has a twin sister named Chloe, another editor removed it saying I shouldn't add name of non notable minor,after debating we agreed on adding Noah has a twin sister only which I did and added citations. Another editor removed it saying is trivia ignoring the talk page which made me go straight to his user talk and question him. For an edit war not to begin I came here to know if adding that Noah Schnapp has a twin sister stand out as trivia? Thanks (also I don't know why "iii" are here I tried removing it but the won't go away) again Thanks Uricdivine (talk) 09:10, 19 June 2022 (UTC)iii

@Uricdivine: @Joeyconnick is not ignoring you, they gave justification in their edit summary and responded to you on their talk page. Unless you have a better source than Instagram, the content about his twin should not be added. ??FormalDude talk 09:36, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
Fwiw, I re-added twin sister, also commented at Talk:Noah_Schnapp#Family. Gr?bergs Gr?a S?ng (talk) 10:33, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
@Uricdivine Is this really important, worth spending time on? 73.127.147.187 (talk) 02:19, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
@FormalDude your wrong he ignored the talk page and reverted my edit which made me go to his user talk page direct. And are you trying to say Noah doesn't have a twin sister?,if you are that is pure ignorance because everyone knows this including stranger things cast and crew and the whole fandom. You said I need reliable sources but any citations I upload about Noah having a twin sister editors will remove which made me go straight to Instagram to find Chloe Schnapp page and also a link to Noah Schnapp page where he celebrated his birthday on October 3. @ Gr?bergs Gr?a S?ng Thank you. ?

How to format a textbox of a certain size
I want to reformat a textbox I made. It looks fine on my Firefox browser but another experienced editor has mentioned a very likely problem, so I'll quote him:

I noticed you used wikimarkup in the textbox to force line breaks. They look fine on my fullsize desktop. Do you already know how that will display on a wide range of devices using both the web and app versions of the en.wiki? Or how it gets crunched when other platforms echo our articles? I was just wondering if maybe such things are reasons to let the text line returns and box length-width change automatically to fit the users technology for best viewing? But like I said, I'm not really interested in learning the tech side of our markup magic, so I'll just leave you to wonder if the line breakmarkup should be reevaluated, or if its good as is. Thanks for caring. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 19:53, 18 June 2022 (UTC)

The box, with my formatting, is at Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election#Reactions. Here it is:

Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a
campaign to overturn a democratic election,
an action unprecedented in American history.
Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower?
it was a coup in search of a legal theory...
If Dr. Eastman and President Trump's plan had worked,
it would have permanently ended
the peaceful transition of power,
undermining American democracy and the Constitution.
If the country does not commit to investigating and
pursuing accountability for those responsible,
the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.
-- Judge David O. Carter, United States district court[1][2]
I suspect he has a point. What I need is a textbox that will look right for all browsers and cellphones. -- Valjean (talk) (PING me) 10:28, 19 June 2022 (UTC)

ValJean, no reason to use right justified text, centering, defined font size and forced breaks. Its not a poem where the style is as relevant as the words. Removing all of that excess formatting creates a blob of text that adjusts to screen size and doesn't look like an attempt to overemphasize parts of the quote.Slywriter (talk) 11:59, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
My focus is on just making a box at the right side of the screen. If I don't add line breaks, it becomes a box that extends from one side of the page to the other side. How can I keep it a box at the right (or left) side? -- Valjean (talk) (PING me) 12:19, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
Here's what a plain quotebox looks like:

Okay, now fixed using a width parameter. -- Valjean (talk) (PING me) 13:55, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
@Valjean You entered the width in pixels. Is 300px what you want for all screen sizes, from cell phones to huge monitors? Isn't there a width percent parameter you could use? 73.127.147.187 (talk) 02:25, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
Width percentage sounds good, but I have no idea how to do that. When I look at the page on my cellphone (Android) the box in any version spreads all the way across the screen, so it doesn't seem to make any difference. It doesn't look like on my pc. -- Valjean (talk) (PING me) 07:56, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
@Valjean Try this: instead of '300px' in the width bit, write '30%' (or whatever % you desire) - that worked for me, at least. StartGrammarTime (talk) 09:52, 21 June 2022 (UTC)

Can I make a page in my user namespace unvisible?

Don't think so, but you can hide it from webcrawling search engines (google, bing etc) by putting {{noindex}} at the top. NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 11:27, 19 June 2022 (UTC)

Sometimes when I'm involved in WP:WIKIDRAMA with an editor who lacks competence in the interests of not pouring gas on the fire I'll try to prep a request for enforcement action but don't want the problem editor to see it until I'm ready for them to see it. So what I do is draft in my Sandbox, and hit preview to verify the markup, but actually save that work in an offwiki text editor. I also use the "nowiki" tags around their user names so they don't get notified if I slip and post my draft by mistake. If I do make that slip and really really care, I ask for that user page to get deleted and just hope the other party doesn't monitor my contribs and explode when they prematurely see a draft. At the same time,I resume work on a different userpage, but again only hitting preview and not "post" NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 11:35, 19 June 2022 (UTC)

Draft:Philipp Hochmair
Hello, I have a very big request.

I have been waiting for my draft - Draft:Philipp Hochmair - to be reviewed for almost four months and have revised it many times. Could someone please look at it and let me know if anything else is wrong so it doesn't get filed again.

I would appreciate it very much. Pacsolis (talk) 17:45, 19 June 2022 (UTC)

Pacsolis Hello and welcome to the Teahouse. As noted on your draft, it could take four months "or more" for a review. Reviews are conducted by volunteers in no particular order(it is not a queue). Please continue to be patient. 331dot (talk) 18:01, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
Thank you for the quick reply.
The waiting time is quite understandable and I am also quite patient. I just wanted to know if a quick look at my design reveals anything that is wrong, since I have already been rejected several times.
Many greetings Pacsolis (talk) 18:09, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
Pacsolis, I would guess your draft is good enough to be accepted if reviewed. But I am not a reviewer.
I note that the first two references are to interviews or accounts of meetings with the subject, the third is just a listing, and the fourth is an "about us" section. So arguably none of these counts as an independent in-depth discussion. There are some better references later. Reviewers may be deterred from completing a review if they read the first four sources without finding reason to accept; so if you want to expedite the review process, you could consider removing some of those early references (with the content they support). You can always put the content back in again later. Maproom (talk) 19:37, 19 June 2022 (UTC)

Off wiki wikibashing
Do we care if editors bash the project and engage in activism against donations to the project? I mean, yeah, we probably care. But do any of the policies and guidelines address that behavior? (Disclaimer... although I'm presenting working in the area of US politics, the editor I ran across doing this on another platform is not.) NewsAndEventsGuy (talk) 01:37, 20 June 2022 (UTC)

There's no real way to control what's done on other websites since none of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines would apply to such things as explained here and here. Even things like WP:BLP and WP:HARASSMENT only apply, in principle, to Wikipedia or Wikipedia user accounts; in other words, even if an account was blocked from editing Wikipedia, there would be no way to block the same person from editing other websites unless it was done by those websites themselves. Whether "you" care is entirely up to you, but personally I don't think there's anything that can be done via Wikipedia. Lots of people are unhappy with things Wikipedia and many often post about their unhappiness on other websites or on social media. There's not much that can be done from a Wikipedia perspective as long as such things stay off of Wikipedia. -- Marchjuly (talk) 02:08, 20 June 2022 (UTC)

@NewsAndEventsGuy: Notice that plenty of regular, well-respected editors engaged in activism against donations to the project on-wiki. That occurs when the WMF does the fundraising drive.

Recording Artist And Dj looking for wikipedia page.
Google search "corey croft music" pulls up all my releases but I'm looking for a wikipedia page. Coreycroft (talk) 04:08, 20 June 2022 (UTC)

Hi @Coreycroft, and welcome to the Teahouse! Please use the article wizard when creating new articles; in particular, we highly discourage writing about yourself, and if you do so, you need to disclose a conflict of interest. Cheers, ?? EpicPupper (he/him | talk) 04:22, 20 June 2022 (UTC)
Coreycroft, By starting here at the teahouse, you have saved your self some headaches. Namely, Wikipedia documents what reliable sources say (See WP:RS, WP:V). Notability is established through those reliable sources (WP:GNG,WP:NMUSIC). So, while google shows you exist, there is nothing from reliable sources for wikipedia to work with. The way this works is get famous and you can have a wikipedia article, not use Wikipedia to get famous (WP:PROMO). Finally, it is not always a good idea to have a wikipedia article, as you will have zero control of the content published (WP:AUTO).
So now that you have saved yourself time and aggravation, use that time to make music (or to help edit wikipedia in other ways) and if/when the time comes that you meet the requirements for a wikipedia article, most likely someone else will create it. Slywriter (talk) 04:25, 20 June 2022 (UTC)
A frequent misunderstanding at Wikipedia is that people assume that listing their output in music, film, TV, books, etc. is sufficient to establish notability, thus justifying an article. That type of information can be included in an article, but what is needed is published content about the person, created by people with no personal or paid connection to the person. (I oversimplify a bit there, but the guidance at WP:GNG and WP:NMUSIC applies.) David notMD (talk) 08:38, 20 June 2022 (UTC)
Another frequent misunderstanding is that a Wikipedia article about you, if such a thing were to exist, would be in any way "your page". It would not belong to you, it would not be controlled by you, it should be based almost entirely on what people unconnected with you had published about you, not on what you or your associates say or want to say, it may end up with content that you don't like, and above all it may never be used for promotion of any kind.

hi @DE100 and welcome to the teahouse! unfortunately there is no easy way to do this (unless you are in chrome or edge and know how to encode a link to highlight a specific portion of an article, which I don't). but if you want to link to a section instead (which is possible and easy), you can link using hashes as such: WP:Teahouse#Creating Citations jumps you in the thread a few threads above. happy editing! ??  melecie  talk - 09:40, 20 June 2022 (UTC)
Thanks for the quick answer. DE100 (talk) 09:42, 20 June 2022 (UTC)
There is no such thing as "line 518" in an article: people look at articles on different devices, on different browsers, and with different screen sizes: the lines get split differently. ColinFine (talk) 10:19, 20 June 2022 (UTC)
It may not make any sense, but diffs do list line numbers, and the latest diff for Romance languages [2] does indeed say that it is for line 518, and it is independent of my display settings. Meters (talk) 10:33, 20 June 2022 (UTC)
I have wondered the same thing. 73.127.147.187 (talk) 02:50, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
DE100 Here's a short-cut trick for you: From the difference window, you can find a short phrase in the given line and search for it. (nothing in code or highlighted). That will jump you to that line. in the article, and the edit window. Good luck, GenQuest "scribble" 03:50, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
@GenQuest Thanks. What do the line numbers actually refer to, internally? 73.127.147.187 (talk) 04:52, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
@DE100: I believe they are just a holdover from early programming days, not sure if there is a purpose to them anymore. Probably ask a more tech-astute person about them. I've only ever seen them on print-outs of programming (esp.: BASIC, C, and CC). I think that was their main purpose, helpful for manually debugging old code.

Hello, Natasha862,and welcome to the Teahouse. It is usually a judgment call whether to edit an article directly, or to discuss it first on the talk page. Generally, if somebody else has already suggested a change on the talk page that you agree with, and nobody has disagreed, you're pretty safe in making the edit yourself. The worst that can happen is that somebody else comes along and reverts, and then you can discuss it further on the talk page. See WP:BRD. ColinFine (talk) 15:44, 20 June 2022 (UTC)

Question About Independent Sources
This is a reply to a question that I was asked on my talk page about a source analysis table that I had provided in an AFD, and I would like the comments of other experienced editors. The question was asked at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon#Just_wish_to_understand_a_little . I had included a source analysis table at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Warina Hussain, and was asked what is meant by Independent Sources. That is discussed in the guideline on Independent Sources. Since the article in question is about a person, the answer to the question is really (a), whether the source is connected directly or indirectly to the actress. A source that is connected to the entertainment industry in general may be positive, neutral, or negative about the actress. Sources generally associated with the entertainment industry may in fact be more likely to know about her, so being associated with the entertainment industry does not make a source non-independent, unless it is associated with the subject or her agent or agency. A source that is in the business of promoting the Indian cinema industry might not be independent. Option (c), about political outlook, is not really about the independence of sources, but about the bias of sources, which is a different related and important question. That is my thought. Do other experienced editors want to comment? Robert McClenon (talk) 18:23, 20 June 2022 (UTC)

Hello, Robert McClenon. There are many entertainment industry sources that are both independent and reliable. So, a focus on the entertainment industry does not invalidate a source. I am not sure how political bias affects entertainment coverage.

Article Draft Declined (Need help)
Hi there,

I created an article for UBC Faculty of Forestry and it got declined when I submitted it for reviewing. The reason is "This submission's references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article." It would really help me if anyone of you could help me figure out how I should fix it.

Hello, Dhritibansai, and welcome to the Teahouse. Please note that Wikipedia is not interested in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them.

Roblox Games not having an article.
I searched up Roblox on Wikipedia and it shows some description. When I looked at the templates, there is an article about "Adopt Me!" Seeming, it is an only article about an Roblox game. But for some reason, there aren't articles about other Roblox games. That includes Work at the Pizza Place, Welcome to Bloxburg, Speed Run, and Zombie Rush, even they are played by tons of users. Since this game has a huge fanbase and popularity, why not create articles about each Roblox game. That would inform readers about the content and the gameplay. Just like other console games, Roblox is about new information and I think there should be a list about each game created. Can you explain why Roblox games don't have an article except Adopt Me? Thank you for answering my question and my curiosity. -- 2601:205:C001:EA0:CD77:605F:EFF3:6FE9 (talk) 00:51, 21 June 2022 (UTC)

hi ip user and welcome to the teahouse! popularity isn't the reason why games (or anything for that matter) get an article. articles are created only if they have significant coverage in reliable sources| such as news articles, which Adopt Me! has had. if you could find these sources and establish their notability, an article could be created. happy reading! ??  melecie  talk - 01:09, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
Why many Roblox Games except for Adopt Me, do not have a significant coverage in reliable sources| such as news articles? Why popularity does not determine notability in Roblox Games? Any further information? 2601:205:C001:EA0:CD77:605F:EFF3:6FE9 (talk) 01:16, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
Adopt Me Find sources: Google (books ? news ? scholar ? free images ? WP refs) ? FENS ? JSTOR ? NYT ? WP Library
Work at the Pizza Place Find sources: Google (books ? news ? scholar ? free images ? WP refs) ? FENS ? JSTOR ? NYT ? WP Library
let's use these as an example. click the News link from here for each of them, which would be the most relevant one to use here (searching for books and scholar would be more appropriate for scholarly/scientific topics). Adopt Me! has gotten some coverage documenting its life and development, while Work at the Pizza Place seems to only be covered in sources documenting opinions on what the best Roblox games are (plural), which isn't enough to establish notability.
additionally, something can be popular but not have enough reliable sources to build an article with, which are required in an article. plus popularity is also a very subjective and thoughts on whether something is popular (especially on a global scale) may vary from person to person. so instead of dealing with whether something is popular or not, we deal with whether something has enough sources to back up its existence and whatever is said in the article. happy reading! ??  melecie  talk - 01:39, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
Explain that while Wikipedia is about reliable sources, why popularity is also a very subjective that may vary from person to person? Does merchandise count as a notability since there are real-life toys about Roblox? -- 2601:205:C001:EA0:CD77:605F:EFF3:6FE9 (talk) 01:43, 21 June 2022 (UTC)

hi @Leahnn Rey! you can link to other Wikimedia projects, such as Wiktionary, through the use of inter-wiki links. for example, if you want to link to the definition of "vivacious", you would use [[:wikt:Vivacious|]], which outputs as Vivacious. (note the colon at the start, see Colon trick, and the pipe at the end, see Pipe trick, both are optional except for colons in inter-language links). similar things can be done with other projects, such as:
[[:commons:Main Page|]]
...which displays as a link to Wikimedia Commons' Main Page

Media updates2021, Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia with articles written about subjects that have received significant coverage in multiple reliable independent secondary sources (WP:N, WP:RS). This is Wikipedia's definition of notable. After looking at the draft on Kimberly Hardin I can see that @Theroadislong was justified in rejecting the article because it truly has no referenced sources (See WP:OR and WP:CITE). I would recommend you read over WP:YFA and then decide if you think you can find these reliable sources on Ms. Hardin. Make sure to properly cite any source in the article prior to resubmitting if that is your conclusion. --ARoseWolf 20:12, 21 June 2022 (UTC)

What to do with patent nonsense that has a source?
There's a paragraph on doujinshi convention that is a load of patent nonsense. Anyone who has even the slightest amount of knowledge on the subject can clearly see this. But the paragraph has a single source (clearly written by someone who has no idea what they're talking about) used to justify it, and another user is opposing its removal as a result. The material is so outlandish and ridiculous that I do not think I can find a source that would be able to refute it, because it's such patent nonsense that nobody would probably think of having to refute something like this. What are the options here? Should clear misinformation be left up, simply because someone published a load of nonsense 10 years ago and nobody bothered to fact check them? 2404:2D00:5000:701:B9D2:5B05:FC57:BA04 (talk) 21:46, 21 June 2022 (UTC)

Actually, after checking, it turns out that the site being cited is listed as an unreliable source, so I'll be removing the offending material. That being said, I would still like to know how situations like this should be handled, when something is clearly wrong but has sources. This seems to be very common with non English language topics on Wikipedia. 2404:2D00:5000:701:B9D2:5B05:FC57:BA04 (talk) 21:57, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
Someone tried reverting my edits claiming that the source was "published by a university". Given the topic material I find it highly doubtful that anyone knowledgeable about the subject vetted the paper, if at all, given how it was being used as a source for statements that were, again, patent nonsense. I cannot find any way to access the paper itself to verify if the patent nonsense is actually in the paper. How should this situation be approached? 2404:2D00:5000:701:B9D2:5B05:FC57:BA04 (talk) 22:17, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
@2404:2D00:5000:701:B9D2:5B05:FC57:BA0: Japanese art conventions are a bit out of my wheelhouse, but after a cursory reading, the issue isn't to me as outlandish and ridiculous as you make it seem in this post. I see you started a discussion on the talk page. Talk:Doujinshi convention#"How it works" section That was the right thing to do. If the source is clearly false, it shouldn't be too hard to find another source that contradicts the info. With incorrect info published in notable journals, a notable instance being the sad history with vaccines and autism, every case is different. Discuss, and if you can't get consensus, see Wikipedia:Dispute resolution. TimTempleton (talk) (cont) 23:26, 21 June 2022 (UTC)
It really is as outlandish as I stated: The problem seems to be that editors on Wikipedia do not have the knowledge needed to deal with the topic either. I am Japanese and someone who has participated in such conventions for years. The crux of the problem with the statement I have issue with is that it states that some people have permission from "erotic game producers" to do something. The entire point of the these conventions is that nobody needs permission to do anything at all, and the "erotic game producers" thing is an absolute non-sequitur with no relevance. 2404:2D00:5000:701:B9D2:5B05:FC57:BA04 (talk) 23:44, 21 June 2022 (UTC)

Hi @Nomonde Danisa. I see that you have submitted a draft. It looks as though you figured out how to add text to an image frame in the end. AFC editors will likely have some feedback for you on this submission - namely the neutrality and objectivity of the article. If you have any conflict of interest with this subject, or if you have received any payment for its creation, please disclose these? Thanks. MaxnaCarta (talk) 00:12, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Hi Nomonde Danisa. In addition, to what's been already posted above, there's an issue with one of the images you uploaded to Commons that you're going to need to resolve if you want to avoid the file being deleted. You can find out more about this by checking your Commons' user talk page. Bascially, you're going to need to provide some way for formally verifying that the image uploaded has been released as licensed since the website hosting the image is claiming copyright ownership over the content appearing on it.
Another thing that you can help clarify is whether you're connected personally or professionally to Vanessa Farsadaki (the person you're trying to create an article about). If, by chance, you're connected to her in someway, you should take a close look at Wikipedia:Conflict of interest and Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure to assess whether either page applies to your particular situation. Being connected to Farsadaki in some way doesn't mean a Wikipedia article about her can be created; it does, however, mean that you're going to need to carefully follow relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines if you're going to be the one trying to create the article. It's very important that you're as transparent as possible regarding any connection or relationship you may have with Farsadaki. Since Wikipedia is a collaborative editing project in which are participants are volunteers, experienced users are sometimes more willing to help others when they feel they're not being being misled or otherwise deceived. So, being transparent about any connection you may have will not only help you avoid problems, but it will also make it easier for others to want to help you if you do run into problems. -- Marchjuly (talk) 01:09, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

Big Clean Up
Hi,

I was wondering where I should go to get more professional help a cleaning up a really messed up article that hasn?t been touched since 2013 (it?s written like WikiHow :/ ). The article in question is ?new business developments?, which is written more like a guide or personal essay than an encyclopedic documentation? thanks.

@Neeshu30 It's not actually a "protected page"; the page was deleted, and the page name was "salted" (the name was protected) to prevent an article by that name being recreated, in April 2021 (if I am reading the page log correctly). 73.127.147.187 (talk) 07:20, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

Hi @SDC3021, welcome to the teahouse. I've tagged it for speed deletion under WP:G7, it should be deleted shortly.Justiyaya 07:42, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
whoops sorry, I didn't check the edit history. Since you are not the only contributor to the draft, it is not elegable for author requested deletion. However, it will be deleted in 6 months (if noone edits it). Justiyaya 07:41, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Oh, I see. So after six months it will be deleted automatically or do I need to request again? Thank you SDC3021 (talk) 01:20, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
@SDC3021: What normally happens is that a semi-automated message will be sent to editors who have worked on the article (though I don't know if the messengers choose all the editors or just the primary ones who've contributed the most) at the 5-month inactivity mark warning them that the draft will be deleted soon. After that the draft will be deleted once it hits the six-month mark with no activity. ?Tenryuu ?? ( ?? ? ?? ) 01:30, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
Writing about emerging artists
I am writing about emerging artists who have done pretty well in their fields. any suggestions! Anuaurora (talk) 09:20, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

@Anuaurora, welcome to the Teahouse! A few points.
Writing a WP-article that "sticks" without any previous WP-experience is hard. Consider just editing some topics that interest you for a while, and check WP:TUTORIAL. Learning how to add references properly is essential, especially if you write about living people, WP has rules about these things. As an example, Oscar Ukonu is an article I wrote. It's pretty basic, but not glaringly WP-awful. Note how sources are used, depending on what they are and say. Your task as a Wikipedian is not to sell your subject, it is to summarize what independent sources (WP:RS) say.
If you have a subject in mind, check WP:BASIC. If you conclude "Yeah, I have those sources, no problem!", move on to WP:BLP and WP:YFA. Good luck! Gr?bergs Gr?a S?ng (talk) 09:57, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Anuaurora If you mean visial or performing contemporary artists, then List of contemporary artists has plenty of examples of articles. David notMD (talk) 21:11, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Unsure what to do about addition to a biographical page
Hello, I am unsure what to do about a recent edit to Samia Suluhu Hassan (leader of Tanzania). It is the last edit, you can read it at the end of the Political reforms and unity section. Its only citation is a literal URL posted as a paragraph rather than a ref. It also lacks any apparent attempt at neutrality and looks to me like agenda editing. As I understand this is bad for biographical pages?

A further question, how do non-developed countries best manage edits that focus on comments leaders make? For example, the page for the previous leader is significantly dedicated to comments he made (he had MUCH to say... haha) rather than anything he did in office, or what happened in Tanzania while he was in office. Is there a good way to avoid the pages being only about comments, and preferably more about providing encyclopedic information about the biographical subject? For another example, Mama Samia's comments on the breast size of the female football players were not a thing she should have said. But it is not particularly relevant to her biography or her role as leader of Tanzania. If the article is not often maintained, as most Tanzania articles are not, is there a way other than constant policing to address this? Maybe a section for them to go? BevoLJ (talk) 11:10, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

Hi @BevoLJ, I've reverted the edit because it contained original reporting and NPOV issues, thanks for bring it up here. I'm not sure how to answer your second question so I'll leave it for other hosts to answer. Although usually it really depends on a case by case basis. Justiyaya 11:42, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Thank you very much. Can you please explain original reporting and NPOV to me? Is this non-natural or agenda editing? BevoLJ (talk) 11:46, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Neutral point of view means that all content should be written without any bias, and should represent all significant views about the subject.This especially applies when the topic is about a living person. It should also be ensured that the content is reliably sourced. So 'agenda-editing', etc. are violations of this policy. Kpddg (talk) 12:12, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Thank you for the explanation. I had learned about the importance of care to living person biographies. But the wording, or acronyms, had confused me. BevoLJ (talk) 12:18, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
As for your article-specific questions, you will get better help at the article talk page, where interested editors can discuss this. Kpddg (talk) 13:08, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Additions to Existing Article
This is not a question; it is just an observation. I recently asked advice from Wikipedia on whether I could add a section to an already very good Wikipedia article on Colonial Pipeline Company. I was advised by the person that responded that I needed to provide primary or original sources. I do not have such, so I abandoned the task.

The CPC article is long and informative, but it does not mention or skims very lightly the control systems that allow this 5500 mile system with more than 200 facilities to be operated from a remote site. There is a lot of whiz-bang stuff about the large diameter pipe, the pumps and motors, the giant valves, the enormous BPD throughput but nothing about how it is controlled. Hint: it is not by humans on site at those facilities.

I know this because I worked directly on designing, building, and installing those SCADA and control systems from 1966 until 2002. But in the end it is not really important. Keep up the good work. MisterURL (talk) 11:13, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

In explanation, this is a side-effect of what Wikipedia is. We are a tertiary source. We rely on secondary sources to decide that something is interesting, go looking for the facts, and check their accuracy. We then collate and summarise information from the secondary sources. We shouldn't go directly to the primary sources: simplistically, primary sources are often biased by their authors, who are inevitably closely connected with the subject. A good author of a secondary source has enough distance to see the subject in perspective and assess how important is that particular primary source, and to know its bias. Also we cannot use our own knowledge, because then we would be our own primary source. If you know something about a subject, what you have to do is go and write the primary or secondary material yourself, and then Wikipedia will have something to work with! It can be very frustrating when we encounter an article that is obviously incomplete, but this usually comes down to the fact that although we consider it interesting and important, so far no one else has done so, at least not enough to get it into print. But this is also what separates us from blog sites and general interest sites. There is nothing to stop a blog from being as accurate as Wikipedia - it's just we try to guarantee the reader sources, and some neutrality as enforced by being a collaborative effort of multiple editors based on the multiple efforts of many secondary sources.

How to handle edits that change names/Wikilinks into their native language?
I do a lot of Anti-Vandalism, and sometimes I come across edits that change links or names into their native language. Here is an example: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Kr%C3%BCss&curid=5697112&diff=1094407247&oldid=1094407096&diffmode=source

How do I handle this? Is this okay, or is it considered disruptive? I'm asking because this is the English Wikipedia, I would assume that text should be kept in English. At least for phrases that are often used in their translated version. Kvoou ??? Talk 12:52, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

It's not even slightly disruptive. Your assumption is mistaken. The IP changed a redlink to the/an English name for a prize to a working link to the article in en:Wikipedia titled with the original German name, and even retained the/an English name as a gloss. The IP should be commended for the edit. -- Hoary (talk) 13:00, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
In this particular case, they inserted a correct wikilink and used the name of the en-WP article, so it's quite constructive. Gr?bergs Gr?a S?ng (talk) 13:51, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
That edit is definitely an improvement. It gives the correct name for the prize (which was not previously given), and follows it by an English translation. It also provides a working wikilink to WP's article about the prize, in place of a redlink. Maproom (talk) 20:05, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

Trouble with citations
Hi Folks

I have uploaded citations for a living Motor Sports personality but am having trouble with the citations. Can anyone help please ?

Many Thanks

RacingProphit Racingprophit (talk) 15:15, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

I'm confused by your question. You say you've uploaded citations, and you're having problems with said citations. Do you mean that some work, and some don't? Or do you mean that none of them work. Regardless, I'd look here: Wikipedia:Citing sources. Another answer might be that you're attempting to insert something into the Automatic Citation section and that isn't working, from there you might want to switch to Manual Citation. Also, you could be on source editor, which is way less straightforward then visual editor. What might help is telling us which article you need help on, and a more experienced editor can walk you through it.

Hi @Racingprophit, welcome to the Teahouse. Referencing for beginners is a good place to start learning how to format citations. I notice that there's a second draft for the same person at Jim Derhaag (yours is at James Derhaag) - that other draft's citations are better formatted, though it's far from perfect, so perhaps you could look at them to get an idea of what to do (and maybe integrate some of the info/sources from that draft into yours). 199.208.172.35 (talk) 16:22, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Reliable sources/Perennial sources
I don't know if this is an appropriate question for the Teahouse, but I'll ask it anyway. When I was looking at WP:RSP, I noticed many of the sources considered reliable have a left-wing bias while many sources with a ring-wing bias are considered unreliable or partly reliable. Why is this? Interstellarity (talk) 16:12, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

Hello, Interstellarity. This article may provide some insights. There are certainly publications on the left that are unreliable. The Palmer Report and Occupy Democrats come to mind. Cullen328 (talk) 16:33, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
On the other hand, conservative publications like the Wall Street Journal and The Weekly Standard (now defunct) are considered reliable, as is the libertarian publication Reason. Cullen328 (talk) 16:45, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Cullen328 has given pretty much the perfect answer, but I'd add that WP:RSP is only a list of the sources that are most discussed, not of every source. Larger conservative publications have garnered more scrutiny over the years, and controversy attracts attention + discussion. I think the article Ideological bias on Wikipedia is an interesting read as well - There are certain areas that seem to have a "liberal" bias, and others that seem to have a "conservative" bias. ThadeusOfNazereth(he/they)Talk to Me! 17:44, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
Thank you Cullen328 and ThadeusOfNazereth for your assistance. The reason why I asked this question is because I want to pay attention to whatever I?m reading online to make sure it is reliable, not solely to improve Wikipedia (although it?s obvious I want what is best for Wikipedia) but just to read to s:::tay informed about current and historical events. I never said that every liberal source is reliable and every conservative source is unreliable because that is obviously not the case. I know there are different kinds of reliable sources depending upon the context and biases. Please let me know how can I determine that the news I?m reading is reliable rather than looking at WP:RSP.

Publishing an article in return for undisclosed payments
I am not an editor of Wikipedia. I sought editorial help from Wikipedia editors in editing and publishing an article about my life, which I believe satisfies the applicable notability requirement. The article was published on the main Wikipedia pages and after about three months was removed to draft status, republished and removed again to draft status with the lead comment that the article "may have been created or edited in return for undisclosed payments, a violation of Wikipedia's terms of use" and that "the author has been sanctioned for failing to disclose paid contributions". I was unaware of any noncompliance with Wikipedia policies by the editor and would like to resubmit this article (and cure an additonal comment that the article may have been promotional) with the help of an editor who will comply with applicable disclosure rules and policies. Can you please advise now to proceed and identify one or more editors who will provide proper editorial assistance and comply with applicable rules and policies, so that the article has a fair chance of being and remaining published. 2603:8001:A401:EB00:4D5C:A4B1:D65D:A793 (talk) 18:47, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

Welcome to the Teahouse, IP editor. Without knowing which draft you're talking about, there's not much any other editor can do to help you. The editor that you communicated most likely ran afoul of neglecting Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure, which is a recurring problem Wikipedia has, and is something that is strongly looked down upon. While you're waiting to see if any interested editor is willing to help you, I encourage you to read the essay An article about yourself isn't necessarily a good thing. ?Tenryuu ??

Based on what was said by the IP, the draft in question seems to be Jack Samet (or maybe Anita Gupta, but that seems less likely). Unfortunately both have been rejected and two of the editors who submitted them have been blocked for COI violations, among other things (a third has simply gone inactive). 199.208.172.35 (talk) 19:21, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
See User talk:GenomeBon for information about the block of the editor who submitted the draft about Jack Samet. Cullen328 (talk) 20:17, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
If the draft article about your life was Declined there is a chance it can be improved and published. However, if it has been Rejected then it is a lost cause, and the project needs to be abandoned. I don?t know what article you are concerned about, so I don?t know the status of it.
Have you read Notability and Referencing for beginners? It isn?t enough for a potential Wikipedia encyclopedia article to prove that you exist, it must also show that your life story meets the notability standards established by Wikipedia. And the way to prove that notability is by finding at least 3 good published references that don?t just mention you in passing, but discuss your life in depth. These references have to be independent of you or anyone working to promote your life. No press releases, information from personal websites, or interviews of you.
The vast majority of Wikipedia editors are volunteers who work on projects they are interested it, and I have no idea how to find an actual experienced Wikipedia editor willing to help write your autobiography. But while you are waiting to find someone to assist you I would suggest you start gathering up as many good references as you can find, so that you can give them to the person who becomes interested in writing your life story.

I have submitted that draft for you. I believe that this person is almost certainly notable. I recommend, though, that you spend some time improving and expanding the draft.

Do you mean like this? [4] -- asilvering (talk) 02:02, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
Hi @ScientistBuilder, to access the tool @Asilvering mentioned, go to the WikiProjects main page, go to "View History", and click on "Page statistics". Urban Versis 32KB ? (talk | contribs) 03:11, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

Auto archiving whatever webpage I add to any articles
When I add a reference or an external links to an article, I want the webpage to be archived. Then I have to check first if it is archived already in its 'normal' status and achive it if it is not. It would be very convenient it is archived automatically whatever link I added. It doesn't have to be archived periodically. Just once in its normal status is fine. I searched about Wikipedia auto archiving but it seems not what I expect. Is there some tool that I want? Regpath (talk) 03:24, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

How do you type at the line of the heading
If you don't know what i'm talking about, i'm talking about the line of the heading, basically, if you make a new section you will see a line, i was wondering how you can type in it, like the good articles and stuff. I'm using the {icon} template and i want to type at the line of the heading, basically if you use the {coord} templates it would appear on the right of the line of the heading. Leahnn Rey (talk) 04:52, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

hi @Leahnn Rey and welcome back! if you want to place stuff at the top of the heading (like the good article icon), you should use {{topicon}} instead of {{icon}} (which displays inline text). if you want to place stuff at the bottom of the heading (like {{coords}}), you'd want to use <span> as such: <span id="coordinates"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </span>, replacing the lipsum with whatever you wanna put in, which assigns them to the location coordinates typically use. examples of both can be found here in my sandbox. happy editing! ??  melecie  talk - 08:39, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
How to Report an Incorrect Photo of a Person on a Page
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brand My great-grandfather was Sir William Alfred Brand C.B.E., cane farmer and politian, who I knew personally - I was a teenager when he passed away. There is a Wikipedia page on his life, which I have no problem with, EXCEPT the fact that the attached PHOTO is NOT him. My mum thinks it is a photo of another man who was also in politics, possibly before or after he served in politics. Anyone who didn't know my "Da" might easily have confused the 2 men as both wearing glasses and similar builds, but it is NOT the same man. Having the incorrect photo on his profile page is somewhat distressing to the older members of my family ie. my mum and her siblings (grandchildren of Sir W A Brand). Is it possible to have this photo removed? You can see a correct photo of my great-grandfather on the website of Australian Dictionary of Biography - https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brand-sir-william-alfred-9573 2001:8003:6460:7800:2D06:7FBA:65EE:E5B3 (talk) 05:00, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

Thank you for raising this. I have taken the liberty of removing the image from the article. Images here tend to be uploaded at Wikimedia Commons, and looking at the information associated with that image, I can't see where it came from, or what evidence there might be that it's genuinely William Brand. We can only include reliable, sourced information, so it shouldn't be there. When it comes to images, unfortunately we can only use images that are free of copyright, or where the copyright has been released in a very generous way, so I don't feel able to use the image you provided. Maybe someone with a better understanding of copyright can reassess! Alternatively, if you have an image to which you own the copyright, you could upload it. I haven't gone looking for the image in other Wikipedias; you might like to do so, as it may have been used incorrectly elsewhere. Elemimele (talk) 06:07, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
Rather to my surprise, Elemimele, Commons shows that this fuzzy little image, which you rightly removed from the en:Wikipedia article, gets quite a lot of use outside en:Wikipedia (and indeed is still used within it). That is unsatisfactory even now; and if nothing is done about it then I imagine that the image will creep back into the article on Brand. However, hasty removal is likely to be summarily reverted. I'll make a start. -- Hoary (talk) 06:17, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
@Elemimele, Per the licensing info at [5], this image [6] appears to be annoyingly out of Commons reach. Ping @Alexis Jazz, if you have any wisdom for us. Gr?bergs Gr?a S?ng (talk) 06:33, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
Feel free to add comments to Deletion requests/File:William Brand.jpg. -- Hoary (talk) 06:32, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
I don't think that we should have too much trouble getting a new image for the article. One solution would be for the IP to upload to Commons a photo of Brand (assuming the IP took one at some point). Alternatively, for deceased individuals, a WP:FAIRUSE image can be hosted on English Wikipedia for use in the article and the one at the link the IP provided seems to meet all the criteria.

Semi-protected article
I just tried to make my first edit to a semi-protected article, an addition to the short description, and I ran into trouble. First, I'm not an anonymous editor and I'm not newly registered (I just qualified for Wikipedia Library priviileges). The edit didn't show up in the preview, or on the page after I published the change. However, the edit showed up just fine in my list of contributions, and in the arti79.155.36.178cle's revision history. The edit is still there on the edit page. The article is The Batman (film) (I justified my edit in the edit summary). Pete Best Beatles (talk) 05:48, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

Hello, Pete Best Beatles. That article is not semi-protected. It is Extended confirmed protected, which is a more stringent form of protection. As for your edit, you are trying to change the short description to 2022 American neo-noir superhero film by Matt Reeves. That description is way too detailed and it should be much more concise. Per Wikipedia:Short description, Editors should bear in mind that short descriptions are not intended to define the subject of the article. Rather, they provide a very brief indication of the field that is covered. You have jammed six different things into the "short" description. Be extremely concise. Cullen328 (talk) 06:05, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
@Cullen328: I was just trying to add "neo-noir" to the existing description. Does "extended confirmed protected" mean I won't be able to make my addition (or that anyone will be able to take your advice either)? "Semi-protected" is what it says in the template on the edit page, that's why I said that. I think it's weird that my edit shows as legitimate on my list of contributions and in the article's revision history, since it didn't take. Pete Best Beatles (talk) 09:27, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
@Pete Best Beatles: If you look at the edit history of the article, you'll see that your edit "took" for a few hours, until SirDot removed it with an edit summary of "Only the primary genre". Mike Turnbull (talk) 10:28, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
Author's pseudonym
While tidying up the article for a children's book series, I discovered the author (Jennifer Rowe) wrote the books under a pseudonym (Emily Rodda). The pseudonym is listed as the author, while the related articles are tagged as 'Books by Jennifer Rowe'. Initially I thought the article had been vandalized before discovering that 'Emily Rodda' links to 'Jennifer Rowe'.

My question: is it reasonable to add the author's name, with something like "Rowan of Rin is a series of five children's fantasy novels by Australian author Jennifer Rowe (under her pseudonym Emily Rodda)"? WP:PSEUDONYM didn't seem to have the answer, and I discovered that there doesn't seem to be much consistency - for example books by Mary Ann Evans aka George Eliot sometimes mention they were written under a pen name and sometimes do not. Thanks in advance for any advice! StartGrammarTime (talk) 06:33, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

@StartGrammarTime: Well, that one is a mess.
If all books in that category had been written by "Emily Rodda", the easy fix would be to rename the category (we have Category:Lady Gaga albums, not Category:Stefani Germanotta albums). But the article Jennifer Rowe says that she wrote children?s books as Emily Rodda and adult books under her own name. The category includes Verity Birdwood, a character from the adult books (it is also questionable whether a character should be in "Category:Books by ...", but the books themselves have no article so far I suppose).
I would say go for your suggestion and see if anyone complains. If there is pushback, a trip to WP:CFD might be required. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 08:47, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
Need help to know why my article is regarded as promoting a company or instituion
Hey Guys, i'm new here, just wondering why my article is regarded as promoting a company or instituion? Since the data resource i provided is coming from a concret and solit media resource, i choose the topic i like to contribute in WikiPedia but still get denied and rejected by directly deleting my contribution withour letting me know where the issue is at, i sincerely ask for help if anyone can guide me on this, Thank you for reading and replying, stay safe. 010e0e (talk) 07:34, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

Hello, 010e0e. I cannot see the article that was deleted after that discussion, but I assume it is similar to Draft:ThunderCore. Some advice has been posted to your talk page, the most important of which being
This submission's references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article?that is, they do not show significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject in published, reliable, secondary sources that are independent of the subject (see the guidelines on the notability of organizations and companies). Before any resubmission, additional references meeting these criteria should be added (see technical help and learn about mistakes to avoid when addressing this issue). If no additional references exist, the subject is not suitable for Wikipedia.

As far as I can tell, the current draft is sourced mostly to press releases and other sources closely associated to ThunderCore, which are therefore not independent. The only source approaching something of the quality we are looking for is Coindesk, but there is consensus that it should not be used because of conflict of interest issues.
I do not really think the draft has issues of promotional tone, but the "qualification for a Wikipedia article" part (called "notability" here) is a big issue. If you cannot find good sources (e.g. mainstream newspaper sources) then you should stop working on the draft altogether because it will never be accepted. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 08:02, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
An important thing to remember, 010e0e, is that Wikipedia is not interested in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is only interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. ColinFine (talk) 09:44, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
In addition to ThunderCore being deleted, the draft you moved to article about Chris Wang (ThunderCore CEO) is at AfD and likely to be deleted. You have not yet replied to a query on your Talk page asking whether you have a conflict of interest (WP:COI) or are paid or otherwise compensated (WP:PAID) for your attempts to create articles about ThunderCore and Wang.

BMW E36 saloon 1994.
Many thanks for definitive article on the BMW E36 saloon cars. The 1994 E36 that I have was classed as BMW E36 and is a 325iSE. The SE I am informed by BMW stands for "Special Equipment" and consists of an electric sun roof and rear headrests. Hope this is of some help. 81.178.174.73 (talk) 08:47, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

Hello, IP user, and thank you for wanting to contribute to Wikipedia. If you have suggestions for improving an article, the best place to make then is on that article's talk page (rather than here, where thousands of editors hang out, quite probably none of whom know anything at about that subject or that article). However, all information in a Wikipedia article should be available in a reliable published source: information that is just from your (or my) personal knowledge is not acceptable - see Verifiability for why that is so important. ColinFine (talk) 09:47, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
Assistance in Editing Page
Hi so I recently updated the page of the California State Legislature, 2021?22 session as it very clearly had not been updated at all in several months (you can see in contributions I did over 3,000 characters worth. And for one of the things I was trying to update was the profile box for Mike McGuire who became Majority Leader of the California State Senate on January 19, 2022. Except whoever did the original table for his profile did it in a way that I have zero idea of adding in his new office as Majority Leader so if anyone who has a lot of experience in creating table's could possibly take a look and add that in that would be super helpful! ?

Hello, Sunnyboi18. If nobody comes forward to help, I suggest asking at WT:WikiProject California or WT:WikiProject Politics. ColinFine (talk) 09:49, 23 June 2022 (UTC)

Early life
McKnight was born in Buffalo, New York to Claude McKnight, Jr. and Ruth Elaine Willis. His music experience began in childhood when he became a member of his church choir, which was directed by his grandfather. McKnight explored different genres of music, and in his early teens, he started musical ambitions by composing instrumental material while learning to play several instruments. McKnight formed a band and began performing his original songs at local venues. By the age of 18, he was offered a publishing deal.[5]

Career
Mercury Records: Brian McKnight and Anytime (1990?1997)
McKnight's older brother, Claude McKnight III (and his band Take 6), signed a record deal with Warner Brothers in 1990. This encouraged McKnight to shop his own demo tapes and by the age of 19, he signed his first recording deal with Mercury Records subsidiary, Wing Records.[6] His self-titled debut album Brian McKnight was released in 1992, and peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200 chart. His first release was "The Way Love Goes", which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[7] The album also featured the ballad, and Top 20 single, "One Last Cry". It was followed by two more albums for Mercury, I Remember You (1995) and Anytime (1997). Anytime, McKnight's final album with Mercury, sold over two million copies and was nominated for a Grammy. The video for "Anytime", directed by Darren Grant, was nominated for Best Male Video at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. In 1997, McKnight recorded "Remember the Magic" for Walt Disney World's 25th anniversary.[citation needed]

Motown Records: Bethlehem and Back at One (1998?2004)
McKnight signed with Motown in 1998 and released a Christmas album, Bethlehem, the first of five albums he released on Motown.

In 1998, McKnight was a guest star on the show Sister Sister. He appeared in multiple episodes, as Tia and Tamera's college professor.

In 1999, McKnight released Back at One, his most successful album to date, which eventually went on to sell over three million copies. Additionally, Back at One is one of four of McKnight's studio albums to reach the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching number 7 on October 9, 1999.[8]

In 2004, McKnight co-wrote the song "Wait" with Australian soul artist Guy Sebastian, which appeared on Sebastian's Beautiful Life album.

Warner Brothers: Ten and media/radio gigs (2005?2014)

McKnight performing in 2006
In late 2005, McKnight signed with Warner Bros. Records and released the album Ten during December 2006. It was his only studio album with the label. Three singles were released from the album: "Find Myself in You" (which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 2006 Tyler Perry movie Madea's Family Reunion), "Used to Be My Girl" and "What's My Name".

In October 2007, McKnight made his Broadway debut in the show Chicago.[citation needed]

Between 2006 and 2010, McKnight hosted The Brian McKnight Morning Show, a radio show with Pat Prescott on KTWV The Wave in Los Angeles. The show was briefly simulcast on KHJZ-FM, Smooth Jazz 95.7 The Wave in Houston, Texas. In January 2009, McKnight hosted "The Brian McKnight Show" on 98.7 KISS FM in New York City.[citation needed]

In 2009, McKnight appeared in the eighth season of Celebrity Apprentice.[9] Each celebrity played to raise money for the charity of his or her choice. McKnight elected to play for Youthville USA.[citation needed]

Between September 2009 and May 2010, McKnight served as the media personality and hosted[10] The Brian McKnight Show, a late night talk show billed as a combination of talk and variety which aired in syndication.

McKnight sang the National Anthem for MLB Opening Day in Cincinnati, Ohio with his sons Brian, Jr. and Niko on March 31, 2011. He had previously sung the National Anthem for the 1997 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland, Game 6 of the 2002 World Series in Anaheim, California (near his Los Angeles home), and the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Detroit. He has also made numerous other "National Anthem" appearances throughout his career. Additionally, McKnight sang "God Bless America" in the 7th inning of Game 7 of the National League Champion Series in San Francisco on October 22, 2012.[citation needed]


McKnight at the 2014 Pioneer of African American Achievement Awards Gala in Beverly Hills, California
On April 23, 2012, McKnight posted to YouTube "If You're Ready To Learn", which has been characterized by Billboard as a "filthy jam". Billboard selected this lyric from the work to quote: "Let me show you how your p?y works / Since you didn't bring it to me first."[11] Other media outlets such as MTV, the Toronto Sun, and NewMediaRockstars[12] have also written about McKnight's recent, more adult-oriented efforts.[13][14] Shortly after the single's release, McKnight and Funny or Die revealed that the single was a collaboration between the two. McKnight later explained that he wrote the parody as a commentary on the state of R&B, which he noted was in a period of degradation overall with famous radio station 98.7 Kiss FM shuttering and hit singles being inferior quality music, among other ailments.[15]

Brian McKnight Music and Kobalt: Better (2015/2016)
On August 14, 2015, McKnight released the single "Uh Oh Feeling", the first track from his album Better. It was released on his own label, Brian McKnight Music LLC via Kobalt Label Services.[16] Better was released on February 26, 2016. The album received positive reviews.[17]

SoNo Recording: An Evening with... and Genesis (2016?present)
On September 23, 2016 (twenty years from the date of his studio album Anytime), McKnight released his first live CD, DVD and Blu-ray collection entitled An Evening with Brian McKnight (in partnership with independent recording label, SoNo Recording Group, via the Universal Music Group). The concert was recorded in Los Angeles, at the historic Saban Theatre. The release includes fourteen songs performed live with his full band, plus three newly written and recorded songs. The first single, "Everything", reached the Top 20 on the national Adult Contemporary charts in September 2016. The CD version of the concert debuted on the Billboard R&B chart at number 13, as a Hot Shot Debut. Also included, is a duet with Gino Vannelli, on the song "Brothers in the End". The Blu-ray and DVD version of the release premiered on the Billboard Music DVD chart at number 9.[citation needed]

McKnight released the album Genesis on August 25, 2017.[18] It featured three Top 30 Urban AC and AC hits: "Everything", "Forever" and "I Want U". Genesis premiered on the Nielsen SoundScan Top 10 Current R&B Albums and Top 20 Current Hip Hop/R&B Albums. The album was produced by Tim Kelley, part of the legendary duo Tim & Bob.[citation needed]

In January 2018, McKnight was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards. He was nominated for Outstanding Male Artist and Outstanding Album for Genesis (alongside Bruno Mars, Charlie Wilson, Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z and Mary J Blige).[citation needed]

In May 2018, McKnight announced he was working on his next studio album tentatively titled Bedtime Story, which would be 60 minutes of music "for the bedroom aka baby-making music".[19]

In 2021, Brian McKnight competed on The Masked Singer spin-off The Masked Dancer as "Cricket".

Personal life
McKnight was married in 1990 to singer-songwriter and his college sweetheart, Julie McKnight. They have two children, Brian Jr., and Niko. They divorced in 2003.[citation needed]

McKnight has a daughter named Brianna McKnight. [20]

In 2014, he began dating Dr. Leilani Malia Mendoza, and they announced their engagement in May 2017.[21] On December 29, 2017, McKnight and Mendoza were married.[22] They share three children: Julia, Jack and Kekoa Matteo. Kekoa Matteo died in infancy. [23]

Religion
Brian McKnight was raised a Seventh-day Adventist. Religion was important in the McKnight family, with many generations being Seventh-day Adventists. His grandfather was a pastor of a church, and his mother played the piano and sang in a gospel choir in Buffalo's Emanuel Temple. Being the youngest of four boys, McKnight became a member of an a cappella gospel quartet with his brothers. He also attended Oakwood College, a Seventh-day Adventist university in Huntsville, Alabama, from 1987 to 1989. In his second year, McKnight got into trouble for violating Oakwood's rules about dormitory visitors for having his girlfriend in his dorm room. They were both expelled.[24][25]
